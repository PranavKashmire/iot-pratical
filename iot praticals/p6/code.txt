code 1 :

# Declaring the number.
n = 4
# Finding square by using pow method
 # This will yield n power 2 i.e. square of n
square = pow(n, 2)
# Printing square
print(square)

code 2 :

number = int(input('Enter a number to get its square '))
# Define a function to calculate Square
def calculateSquare(num):
   return number*number
# print the output
print("Square of ",number, "is ", calculateSquare(number))
